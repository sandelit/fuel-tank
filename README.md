# Fuel tank management system

Simple application built for a local car dealership to help them keep track of the large fuel tank they have.
The employees can add a transaction when they fill up cars with the relevant information. When the tank is refilled they can add that in the application  so as to easier keep track of the fuel level and making sure to order more as needed. 

Built using SvelteKit, TailwindCSS (with Skeleton component library) & Supabase
